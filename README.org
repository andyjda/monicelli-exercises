#+TITLE: README
* Code
Monicelli is an [[https://github.com/esseks/monicelli][esoteric programming language]] inspired by the legendary Italian comedy movie [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoEK2Z3-JH8][Amici Miei]]
* Compile and Run
Follow the instructions at the [[https://github.com/esseks/monicelli/blob/master/README.md#compilation][Monicelli README]] to build a compiler, then simply run "mcc mcc gcd.mc -o gcd" to compile, and "./gcd" to run. The program expects two integers from stdin, and will compute the greatest common divisor, using Euclid's algorithm.
